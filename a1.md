# Simulation of Mind Hypothesis

Knowledge codes for physical transformations. Matter is rearranged from one state to another in the presence of knowledge. 

Knowledge is physically instantiated upon information media, and can exist without a knowing subject.

Knowledge is hard to vary while still being an improvement. Its information could have been otherwise but is a specific way because of its causal power. 

Knowledge is created by an adversarial process of variation and selection. Knowledge that causes itself to be copied.

Selection is via problems.  The environment is the adversary.  Knowledge is selected that models its environment well enough to cause itself to be copied. Knowledge solves the problems posed by its environment. 

Some knowledge has reach beyond the problem it solved that caused itself to get copied.

The environment is not chaotic. Regularities in the environment at different layers of emergence are used to model it. 

A model forms an expectation of what will occur. Expectation is a basis for action. Expected outcomes have positive or negative utility to the agent that can be obtained or avoided depending on how true is the model.

The environment is not static. Changes pose new problems. Problems are unpredictable and inevitable.

The environment can be simulated and then the predicted outcomes tested by evidence from sensors. 

The real, objective, physical world is the adversary for our simulation. 

An agent is the vehicle for replicators. The agent is output by a transformation of matter coded for in genes. The vehicle is part of the replication process of genes.

The environment contains the agent so a more accurate model includes simulation of the agent. The agent in the environment can be simulated.

The agent also experiences the environment. Physical objects impinge on the agent's body.  

The physical interactions between environment and body are converted to information in the agent; a measurement task.

The regularity of response in an agent from information in the environment are abstracted as senses.

Information about the environment is flowed to the agent through a physical process that translates the physical to abstract. 

The feelings of the agent can be simulated.  What does it mean to simulate a subjective feeling? And how is that different from the feeling itself? To simulate a feeling is to create the knowledge of the feeling as applied to the simulated agent. To simulate creating knowledge is to create knowledge. 

A feeling is counterfactual. If the agent sensed this then this is how it would have felt. The counterfactual becomes fact in simulations where the resolution is good enough to fool the adversary. 

Some things can't be faked. To fake courage in order to act when afraid is to have courage. To fake creating the knowledge to pass a test is to have the knowledge. To simulate the knowledge of what something felt like is to know what it felt like.

A feeling is an abstraction that has casual power in the physical world.  It is like the desktop metaphor of a computer system.  The files and folders are abstractions used to interface with the system. The "files and folders" abstraction is embodied by the system and it causes itself to persist. A file is an abstraction; both the physical and digital kind.  It exists via the replication of a meme. It then becomes a regularity in the environment through the persistence of knowledge. 

Abstractions are selected that help cause a replicator to reproduce in its environment relative to its rivals. They are guessed at. Created ex nihilo.

A feeling is knowledge of how it would have felt. Tested in a simulation of the environment and subject. 

Many attempts at creating knowledge fail. A whole ecosystem survives to the next generation. 

The task of simulating how an experience would have felt to a subject using abstractions is a possible task.

The evolutionary process can be simulated to generate knowledge faster. Faster than the birth, growth, reproduce cycle of an organism. The rate of iteration can be increased. The "search" for action adapted to the environment is the output of many generations of adversarial simulation.

The simulation is of the agent using guesses from existing background and new variants of old guesses, against an adversary of the simulated environment. 

The model of the environment running on the computer that was arranged by matter coded for by knowledge stored in DNA. 
The agent is now "thinking". The simulation should now include a thinking agent. The simulation includes the thoughts and feelings of the agent in its environment.

The simulation outputs actions that the agent performs that cause knowledge contained in the agent to be replicated.

Because people create knowledge, the simulation includes the creation of knowledge as thoughts and at that point becomes a universal explainer.

Objective knowledge is key.  Not any old information will do. Knowledge is information with causal power.

To anticipate knowledge created in the environment we must simulate knowledge creation,  and so create knowledge. The agent is now creating memes. The simulation is of an agent in an environment feeling sensations and creating knowledge by reading words and thinking thoughts in its mind. 

These words on the page and your experience reading them are the simulation in your mind of what an agent would think and feel. The simulation tries to guess at the environment and all the things in it relevant to causing itself to be replicated in that environment. This includes the simulation of your own thoughts that you would have experienced if you were in that environment. And because the simulation created knowledge to run that test, then you did feel it.

The knowledge does exist of what it felt like when you read those words. And that knowledge had casual power. Not just any information. 

The environment contains other people so the simulation must include a theory of other people's minds and the agent interacting with them.

How can thought cause action? Is there a possibility of doing otherwise. 

The role of knowledge in physical reality. Once created it codes for physical transformation. Knowledge causes the environment to copy itself.
