Hi! I'm Caerwyn Jones. I work at [Raytheon Technologies](http://rtx.com).   

From 1997 to 2010 my personal interests were in operating systems, especially the philosophy of Unix, Plan 9 and Inferno OS.  
For a number of years I published a blog on my experiments using the Inferno OS, called the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com). 

My interests at work are in digital strategy, aerospace, and recently in reinforcement learning. I build software and have been making software since 1996.
