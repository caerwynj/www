Hi! I'm Caerwyn Jones. I have been making software since 1996. I work at [Raytheon Technologies](http://rtx.com).  I formerly worked at CSC, Lucent, and a few small software companies in the Boston Metro area.

From 1997 to 2010 my personal interests were in operating systems, especially the philosophy of Unix, Plan 9 and Inferno OS.  
For a number of years I published a blog on my experiments using the Inferno OS, called the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com). 

I'm currently working on digital strategy within aerospace, and implementing reinforcement learning applications.

## Repositories
* [Inferno Lab](https://github.com/caerwynj/inferno-lab). Source code for all the prototype software I made in the Inferno operating system over a number of years. Much of it is written in the Limbo programming language, a precursor to Go. It had excellent support for communicating sequential processes much like Go.
* [Acme SAC](https://github.com/caerwynj/acme-sac). The Acme editor was developed by Rob Pike for the Plan 9 operating system. It was ported to Inferno OS by VitaNuova.  I made it a "standalone" editor for Windows and other operating systems by packaging and customizing the editor and Inferno OS. The original Acme editor is part of [Plan 9 from user space](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/) port to Unix like systems and I recommend you use that version.

## Notes
In my own time I think about the prospects of implementing an AGI, and I collect some of my notes here.  See also my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caerwy)  where I tweet mostly about AGI.
