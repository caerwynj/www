This is the personal home page of Caerwyn Jones. I am a manager at [United Technologies](http://utc.com) where I work on digital strategy for Pratt & Whitney.  

In the past I have worked on software for telephone switching, telephone billing, and technical publications. 

My personal interest for a while were in operating systems, especially Unix, Plan 9 and Inferno OS.  For a number of years I published a blog on my experiments on the Inferno OS, called the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com).

I'm slowly moving the source code and updating the blog by putting it in GitHub.  See my [Inferno Lab](http://lab.caerwyn.com).

I'm on Twitter [@caerwy](https://twitter.com/caerwy?lang=en).
