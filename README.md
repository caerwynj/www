From 2004 caerwyn.com focused on operating systems from Bell Labs, especially the philosophy of Unix, Plan 9 and Inferno OS, by hosting a blog of experiments using the Inferno OS, called the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com).  Since 2022 I have started working on Inferno OS again, porting it to the Raspberry Pi Pico.  Check out the repositories below.

## Repositories
* [Inferno Lab](https://github.com/caerwynj/inferno-lab). Source code for all the prototype software made in the Inferno operating system over a number of years. Much of it is written in the Limbo programming language, a precursor to Go. It had excellent support for communicating sequential processes much like Go.
* [Acme SAC](https://github.com/caerwynj/acme-sac). The Acme editor was developed by Rob Pike for the Plan 9 operating system. It was ported to Inferno OS by VitaNuova.  Made into  a "standalone" editor for Windows and other operating systems by packaging and customizing the editor and Inferno OS. The original Acme editor is part of [Plan 9 from user space](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/) port to Unix like systems and I recommend you use that version.
* [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/caerwyn). Docker images for Inferno and Acme-SAC.
* [Inferno OS on Raspberry Pi Pico](https://github.com/caerwynj/inferno-os/tree/pico).  Inferno OS ported to the Raspberry Pi Pico using the GCC toolchain and PICO SDK.
