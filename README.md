This is the personal home page of Caerwyn Jones. I am a manager 
at [United Technologies](http://utc.com) where I work on digital strategy for Pratt & Whitney.  

In the past I have been a software engineer working on software for telephone switching, 
telephone billing, and technical publications. 

From 1997 to 2010 my personal interests were in operating systems, especially the philosophy of Unix, Plan 9 and Inferno OS.  
For a number of years I published a blog on my experiments using the Inferno OS, called the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com).
