# Networks of AI

Assume all life on the planet is one continuous, evolving, open-ended network.  The internet has grown orders of magnitude since its inception, but never broken. It has replaced all its atoms, but never been taken down.  Yet if all humans ceased to exist the internet would end.

The internet is not alive.  It depends on knowledge created by humans.  If all humans ceased to exist, life of earth would continue.  If all other life on earth ceased to exist could humans continue?

If humans colonized another planet then a new network of life would be created independent from life on earth.  Humans are reaching the point of creating independent networks of life. An open-ended stream of knowledge creation.

If an AGI is also an open-ended stream of knowledge creation, then once we create one, we are creating an independent network of life.  If all humans ceased to exist the AGI would be able to continue.

AI today is finite.  They are a tool and would stop functioning if humans disappeared.  The jump to universality for AI may require a network that can self-sustain itself, in an environment that provides an open-ended stream of problems.
